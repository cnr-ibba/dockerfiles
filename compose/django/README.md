# Running Django+MySQL-uwsgi with docker-compose

This guide describe how to build a running Django+MySQL running with docker-compose. First of all copy all this directory in another location since you will modify something to develop your application. Next, rename the whole directory with a project name. In this example, all names are set to `mysite`. Replace all `mysite` occurences with your project name. All docker container instances will have such name as a prefix in their name. There are some directory that will be mounted as data volume: this will make easier to develop the code or re-spawn the docker application on another location using the same volume directory (as it would be for mysql-data directory). For this model, al MySQL data file will be placed in `mysql-data` directory inside this project; All django data will be placed in `django-data` directory inside this project. When such directories are created for the first time, there are created and mounted as a root directories. After permission can be fixed according user need. However processes like `nginx` and `uswgi` work with a different user from root, and so files have to be accessed in read mode

## The docker-compose.yml file

Before to start take a look in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This is the configuration file used by `docker-compose` commands. All `docker-compose` commands need to be instantiated in this directory or by specifying the path of `docker-compose.yml` file, as stated by the [docker compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). For such compose project, 3 containers will be instantiated:

1. `db`: in this container will be placed the mysql 5.6 server. This container will be listen for `uwsgi` django container
2. `uwsgi`: this will be the django container in which uwsgi server will run. This container will be linked with `db` container
3. `nginx`: this container will have nginx installed. All static files will be served by nginx by sharing static content as docker volumes between containers. Django files will be served by the appropriate container via fastCGI plugin.

Those name will be placed in each container `/etc/hosts` files, so you can ping `uwsgi` host inside `nginx` container, for instance, no matter what ip addresses will be given to the container by docker. When starting a project for the first time, data directory and initial configuration have to be defined. Data directories will be placed inside this directory, in order to facilitate `docker-compose` commands once docker images where configured for the application. When data directories are created for the first time, the ownership of such directories is the same of the service running in the container. You can change it as you prefer, but remember that service run under a *non privileged* user, so you have to define **at least** the *read* privileged for files, and the *read-execute* privileges for directories.

## Setting up *.env* variables

You can set variables like password and users using [environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/)
that could be passed on runtime or by *env files*. The default *env file* is a `.env`
file placed inside django docker-composed root directory. This file **MUSTN'T** be
tracked using *CVS*

> You should also store sensitive informations using [docker secrets](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/engine/swarm/secrets/)

Create a `.env` file inside project directory, and set the following variables:

```txt
DEBUG=True
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<mysql password>
SECRET_KEY=<your django secret key>
MYSQL_DATABASE=<django database name>
MYSQL_USER=<django user>
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<django password>
```

## Create the MySQL container

Once `db` container is istantiated for the first time, `mysql-data` directory is created
and MySQL is configured to have users and password as described in the `.env` file.
After that, container could be destroyed and data will persists inside `mysql-data`
directory. If you nedd extra stuff to be done after database creation, you could
define *sql* and *sh* scripts inside a directory that need to be mounted in
`/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` as in the following example:

```yml
# to export volume, as recommeded in https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/mysql/
volumes:
  - type: bind
    source: ./mysql-data/
    target: /var/lib/mysql

  - type: bind
    source: ./mysql-initdb/
    target: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
    read_only: true
```

Each script inside `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory will be executed after
database creation. Once database is created, those scripts will not be executed
anymore.

The MySQL container defined in `docker-compose.yml`,
never expose a port outside, but you may want to expose it to access data with a MySQL client.
You can get a mysql client to this container usind a db container, for instance:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm db mysql -h db -u root -p
```

### Dumping data from database

With the docker run command, you can do a `mysite` database dump:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm db /bin/sh -c 'mysqldump -h db -u root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD mysite' > dump.sql
```

### Loading data in database

With the docker run command, you can import a `.sql` file by adding its path as
a docker volume, for instance, if you are in `mysite_dump.sql` directory:

```bash
cat dump.sql | docker-compose run --rm db /bin/sh -c 'mysql -h db -u root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD mysite'
```

### Access database using adminer

You can access to mysql container using adminer, you need to connect to
docker composed instance using the same network, for example:

```bash
docker run -d --link django_db_1:db -p 8080:8080 --name adminer --network django_default adminer
```

More information could be found in [adminer - docker hub][adminer-docker-documentation]

## Create django container

Django script will be served using the uwsgi server. You can get more informaton here:

* [How to use Django with uWSGI](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/uwsgi/)
* [Django and NGINX](https://uwsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html)
* [uwsgi configuration](https://uwsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Configuration.html)

### Fixing Dokerfile and uwsgi.ini files

Take a look in to the uwsgi directory:

```bash
$ tree uwsgi
uwsgi
├── Dockerfile
└── requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` is a list of python modules which will be installed when the image is builded for the first time.
All python modules needed by the application needs to be specified here one by line.

### Creating a project for the first time

For such example, we suppose that the django project name will be `mysite` as stated
by the [django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project).
The `mysite_uwsgi.ini` in `django-data` directory contains uwsgi configuration for this application.
The default path of the application is the `mysite` directory of the django tutorial.
If you want to modify the project directories, remember to modify `docker-compose.yml`
and to rename `mysite_uwsgi.ini`commands according your needs.
Now you can build the django image from its `Dockerfile` or build it automatically
with `docker-compose`. In this case, we initialize a new project and we build a new
docker image if it not exists (since we have not specified a destination directory,
a `mysite` project directory is created and placed under `/var/uwsgi/`.
Inside mysite, we will have `manage.py`):

```bash
docker-compose run --rm uwsgi django-admin.py startproject mysite
```

This will build the django image and runs the `django-admin.py` script. If there
are prerequisites, for example containers linked to that, they will be started before
the `uwsgi` django container. After that, the container stops and we return to the
shell environment. You may want to fix file permissins in order to edit files, for
example:

```bash
sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} django-data
```

Next, you may need to set a list of strings representing the host/domain
names that this Django site can serve: you will modify the `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
as described [here][django-allowed-host]. To avoid to store sensitive information
inside `settings.py`, you may want to refere to [python-decouple](https://github.com/henriquebastos/python-decouple)
documentation. With this module, you can store sensitive information as
environment variables or in another `.env` file that need to be placed in the
sample directory of `settings.py`

[django-allowed-host]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts

```python

from decouple import config

# ... other stuff

# SECURITY WARNING: keep the secret key used in production secret!
SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')

# SECURITY WARNING: don't run with debug turned on in production!
DEBUG = config('DEBUG', cast=bool, default=False)

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
```

Now we need to set up the database connection. You may want
change default ownership to edit files. Replace the `DATABASES = ...` definition
in `django-data/mysite/mysite/settings.py` accordingly your project database settings:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': config('MYSITE_DATABASE'),
        'USER': config('MYSITE_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': config('MYSITE_PASSWORD'),
        'HOST': 'db',
        'PORT': 3306,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
        },
    }
}

# configuration for postgres Database
# DATABASES = {
#     'default': {
#         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
#         'NAME': config('MYSITE_DATABASE'),
#         'USER': config('MYSITE_USER'),
#         'PASSWORD': config('MYSITE_PASSWORD'),
#         'HOST': 'db',
#         'PORT': 5432,
#     }
# }
```

Note that the `db` host is the same name used in `docker-compose.yml`. User, database
and password are the same specified in the example above. Remember to set the timezone:
docker compose will export HOST /etc/localtime in read only mode, but it's better
to set timezone also in django in order to have correct times:

```python
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Rome'
```

We have to set also the static file positions. It's better to prepend the django
project names in order to write rules to serve static files via nginx. Here is an
example for mysite project:

```python
# Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/static-files/
STATIC_URL = '/mysite/static/'
MEDIA_URL  = '/mysite/media/'

# collect all Django static files in the static folder
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static/")
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "media/")
```

The `STATIC_URL` variable will tell to django (uwsgi) how to define links to static
files, and the `STATIC_ROOT` variable will set the position in which static files
(as the admin .css files) will be placed. The `MEDIA_ROOT` and `MEDIA_URL` variables
have the same behaviour. You may want to create a `/static` and `/media`
directory inside `mysite`, in order to place media files. Then you have to call
the `collectstatic` command in order to place the static files in their directories:

```bash
mkdir django-data/mysite/static/
mkdir django-data/mysite/media/
docker-compose run --rm uwsgi python mysite/manage.py collectstatic
```

#### Auto restart uwsgi when code is modified

As stated [here](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ThingsToKnow.html?highlight=autoreload)
autoreload could be CPU intensive and must be used only in developmente environment:
*"Some plugins (most notably Python and Perl) have code auto-reloading facilities.
Although they might sound very appealing, you MUST use them only under development
as they are really heavy-weight. For example the Python –py-autoreload option will
scan your whole module tree at every check cycle."*

#### Change working_dir in docker compose file

To avoid the necessity of specify relative path every time `manage.py` is called,
you may want to change the working_directory in `docker-compose.yml` file to point
on your application directory, for example:

```yaml
  # set working dir for uwsgi
  working_dir: /var/uwsgi/mysite
```

This allows to call `manage.py` from the `mysite` project directory

#### Initialize django database for the first time

You may want to run the following commands to create the necessary django tables
if django database is empty. The path of `manage.py` is not specified, since we
changed the `working_dir` in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm uwsgi python manage.py migrate
```

More info could be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/#database-setup)

#### Creating an admin user

You  need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm uwsgi python manage.py createsuperuser
```

A user and password for the admin user will be prompted. Ensure to track such
credentials

### Add an existing project to django container

The `django-data` directory need to be create if does't exists. Then you have to
create a `<project name>` directory in which put the `manage.py`. Static files needs
to be placed inside the `<project name>` directory, or links or static urls needs
to be modified in order to be served correctly. For instance, to place a django
project into a `mysite` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p django-data/mysite
cp -r /a/django/project/ django-data/mysite/
mkdir django-data/mysite/media
mkdir django-data/mysite/static
```

## Create NGINX container

Let's take a look inside nginx directory:

```sh
$ tree nginx
nginx/
├── conf.d
│   └── default.conf
├── Dockerfile
└── nginx.conf
```

The `nginx.conf` contains general configuration for NGINX. If you need to run d
different processes or listen for a different number of connection, you may modify
this file. The `default.conf` located in `conf.d` is the file which need to be modified
accordingly to your project location. You can modify this file without building
nginx image, since this directory is imported as a volume in nginx container.
In this sample configuration, the served application is supposed to be under `mysite`
location. Django static files are served via nginx by sharing volumes between
django `uwsgi` container. This container expose the standard 80 port outside, but
`docker-compose.yml` could bind this port to a different one

## Starting containers with docker compose

Now start database and django (in daemonized mode):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can inspect docker logs with

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

Container could be stopped and restarted via `docker-compose` compose. Even if
container are dropped, all files in *data volumes* directories remains and don't
need to be reconfigured as the first instance. You can also run management commands
with Docker. To migrate django database, for example, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm uwsgi python mysite/manage.py migrate
```

Or

```bash
docker-compose run --rm uwsgi python manage.py migrate
```

If you have set the `working_dir` in `docker-compose.yml` properly.

## Serving docker containers in docker HOST

You can serve docker compose using HOST NGINX, for instance, via proxy_pass.
Place the followin code inside NGINX server environment. Remember to specify the
port exported by your docker NGINX instance:

```conf
location /mysite/ {
  # set variable in location
  set $my_port 10080;

  # Add info to webpages
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host:$my_port;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $my_port;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_pass_header Set-Cookie;

  # Subitting a request to docker service
  proxy_pass http://<your_host>:$my_port;
  proxy_redirect http://$host:$my_port/ $scheme://$http_host/;
}
```
