# maximum query size server can process (Important when working with
# large BLOBs).  enlarged dynamically, for each connection.
max_allowed_packet	= 16M

# Thread stack size to use. This amount of memory is always reserved at
# connection time. MySQL itself usually needs no more than 64K of
# memory, while if you use your own stack hungry UDF functions or your
# OS requires more stack for some operations, you might need to set this
# to a higher value.
thread_stack		= 256K

# How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse. When a client
# disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't
# more than thread_cache_size threads from before.  This greatly reduces
# the amount of thread creations needed if you have a lot of new
# connections. (Normally this doesn't give a notable performance
# improvement if you have a good thread implementation.)
thread_cache_size	= 8

# The maximum amount of concurrent sessions the MySQL server will
# allow. One of these connections will be reserved for a user with
# SUPER privileges to allow the administrator to login even if the
# connection limit has been reached.
max_connections        = 200

# The number of open tables for all threads. Increasing this value
# increases the number of file descriptors that mysqld requires.
# Therefore you have to make sure to set the amount of open files
# allowed to at least 4096 in the variable "open-files-limit" in
# section [mysqld_safe]
table_cache = 4096

# The number of table definitions that can be stored in the definition cache.

# cache to speed up opening of tables. The table definition cache takes less 
# space and does not use file descriptors, unlike the normal table cache.

# desired number of threads that should be run at the same time.  This
# value only makes sense on systems that support the thread_concurrency()

# You should try [number of CPUs]*(2..4) for thread_concurrency

# Maximum allowed size for a single HEAP (in memory) table. This option
# is a protection against the accidential creation of a very large HEAP
# table which could otherwise use up all memory resources.

# Questa variabile influenza anche la variabile tmp_table_size, per cui
# non posso avere una variabile tmp_table_size piu' grande di max_head_table_size

# Sort buffer is used to perform sorts for some ORDER BY and GROUP BY

# This buffer is used for the optimization of full JOINs (JOINs without
# indexes). Such JOINs are very bad for performance in most cases
# anyway, but setting this variable to a large value reduces the
# performance impact. See the "Select_full_join" status variable for a
# count of full JOINs. Allocated per thread if full join is found
#
# A questo indirizzo (http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2010/07/05/how-is-join_buffer_size-allocated/)

# per thread come tutte le altre storie). Per questo puo' essere rischioso
# un valore >= 4M (come suggerisce tuning-primer.sh)

# grows larger than this value, it is automatically converted to disk
# based table This limitation is for a single table. There can be many
# of them.

# * Query Cache Configuration
#

# Only cache result sets that are smaller than this limit. This is to
# protect the query cache of a very large result set overwriting all
# other query results.
query_cache_limit = 2M

# Questa variabile dovrebbe impostare la dimensione minima di una query
# per poter essere memorizzata nella query cache
query_cache_min_res_unit = 4K

# Query cache is used to cache SELECT results and later return them
# without actual executing the same query once again. Having the query
# cache enabled may result in significant speed improvements, if your
# have a lot of identical queries and rarely changing tables. See the
# "Qcache_lowmem_prunes" status variable to check if the current value
# is high enough for your load.
# Note: In case your tables change very often or if your queries are
# textually different every time, the query cache may result in a
# slowdown instead of a performance improvement.

#
# * Slow queries
#

# Log slow queries. Slow queries are queries which take more than the
# amount of time defined in "long_query_time" or which do not use
# indexes well, if log_long_format is enabled. It is normally good idea
# to have this turned on if you frequently add new queries to the
# system.

# All queries taking more than this amount of time (in seconds) will be

# even very fast queries being logged from time to time (as MySQL
# currently measures time with second accuracy only).
long_query_time = 5

# Log more information in the slow query log. Normally it is good to
# have this turned on. This will enable logging of queries that are not
# using indexes in addition to long running queries.

# query che non struttano correttamente gli indici
#log_queries_not_using_indexes

#
# *Variabili per MyISAM

# Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocks for MyISAM tables.
# Do not set it larger than 30% of your available memory, as some memory
# is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even if you're not using
# MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 8-64M as it will also be
# used for internal temporary disk tables.

# Allocated per thread, if a full scan is needed.

# through this buffer to avoid disk seeks. You can improve ORDER BY
# performance a lot, if set this to a high value.
# Allocated per thread, when needed.
read_rnd_buffer_size = 8M

# MyISAM uses special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts (that is,
# INSERT ... SELECT, INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ..., and LOAD DATA
# INFILE) faster. This variable limits the size of the cache tree in
# bytes per thread. Setting it to 0 will disable this optimisation.  Do
# not set it larger than "key_buffer_size" for optimal performance.
# This buffer is allocated when a bulk insert is detected.
bulk_insert_buffer_size = 64M

# This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuild the index in
# REPAIR, OPTIMIZE, ALTER table statements as well as in LOAD DATA INFILE
# into an empty table. It is allocated per thread so be careful with
# large settings.
myisam_sort_buffer_size = 64M

# The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use while
# recreating the index (during REPAIR, ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA INFILE.
# If the file-size would be bigger than this, the index will be created
# through the key cache (which is slower).
myisam_max_sort_file_size = 10G

# If the temporary file used for fast index creation would be bigger
# than using the key cache by the amount specified here, then prefer the
# key cache method.  This is mainly used to force long character keys in
# large tables to use the slower key cache method to create the index.

# Dal mysql 5.1 è deprecata e sarà rimossa
#myisam_max_extra_sort_file_size = 10G

# If a table has more than one index, MyISAM can use more than one
# thread to repair them by sorting in parallel. This makes sense if you

# *** INNODB Specific options ***

# Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB to store metadata
# information.  If InnoDB requires more memory for this purpose it will

# value. SHOW INNODB STATUS will display the current amount used.
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 16M

# InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and
# row data. The bigger you set this the less disk I/O is needed to
# access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
# too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may
# cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you
# might be limited to 2-3.5G of user level memory per process, so do not
# set it too high.
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 3G

# InnoDB stores data in one or more data files forming the tablespace.
# If you have a single logical drive for your data, a single
# autoextending file would be good enough. In other cases, a single file
# per device is often a good choice. You can configure InnoDB to use raw

# logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and

# How long an InnoDB transaction should wait for a lock to be granted
